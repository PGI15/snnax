# Structure

SNNAX contains the following main components:

| Component                                        | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Architecture](../200_architecture/200_intro.md) | Represents the model architecture, allowing users to create custom SNN architectures.        |
| [Layers](../300_layers/300_intro.md)             | Provides different layers that can be used in the model implementation.                      |
